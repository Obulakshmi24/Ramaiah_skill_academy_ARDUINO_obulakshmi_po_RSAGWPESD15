### 1. DISTANCE MEASUREMENT DISPLAY
**QUESTION** Connect an ultrasonic sensor and a 7-segment display to the Arduino. Program it to measure the distance to an object in front of the ultrasonic sensor and display the result on the 7-segment display.

### 2. SMART DISTANCE COUNTER
**QUESTION** Connect both an ultrasonic sensor and a touch sensor to the Arduino. Display a counter on the 7-segment display that increments every time an object (such as a hand) crosses a specified distance threshold (detected by the ultrasonic sensor). Use the touch sensor to reset the counter.

### 3. TOUCH-ACTIVATED RANGE FINDER
**QUESTION** Program the Arduino to take a distance reading from the ultrasonic sensor only when the touch sensor is activated. Display the measured distance on the 7-segment display and hold the value for 5 seconds before clearing.

### 4. COUNTDOWN TIMER WITH OBSTACLE FINDER
**QUESTION** Use the touch sensor to start a countdown on the 7-segment display. If the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle (within a specified range) during the countdown, reset the timer. Display "E" on the display if the countdown

### 7. TEMPERATURE MONITERING SYSTEM
**QUESTION** Using a DHT11 temperature sensor, create a temperature monitoring system that reads temperature data and displays it on the Serial Monitor. Adjust the code to send a warning message if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.

### 8. PEOPLE COUNTER WITH DIRECTION FINDER
**QUESTION:**  Place an IR sensor on either side of a doorway to count the number of people entering and exiting. Display the count on a 7-segment display. Use the ultrasonic sensor to confirm direction by measuring the time an object passes between the two IR sensors.
